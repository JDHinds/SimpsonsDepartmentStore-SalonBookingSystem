# SimpsonsDepartmentStore-SalonBookingSystem
 Simpsons Department Store - Salon Booking System (CCEA A-Level Software Systems Development Coursework 2022)
 
This is my A2 project for SSD, a booking system built in Windows Forms. Given the choice between an office rental system and a salon booking system, I chose this, along with two others in my class. All in all, it was really quite fun.

In this project, I used;

- C#
- The .NET Framework
- SQL
- Report Definition Language (SSRS)
- Custom Form Controls
- Dynamically Assigned Click Events

I'm very pleased with how it turned out. If you want to know more, there's an entire write-up in there.
